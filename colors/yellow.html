    	    </h2>
    	    <p> 
    		    This is the key tone that gives way to orange, sandy, brownish, chartreuse. But despite the fact that it belongs to warmth, its shades can belong to the opposite scale. For example, the contrast between lemon and something like egg yolk. <br> <br>

                For a woman preparing to become a mother, it symbolizes a successful birth. Often schizophrenics or people who are in search of a positive outcome from the current situation show love for him.<br><br>

                In Asia, the designation of yellow is reduced to a mournful state or even death. And in ancient times it was a sign of the frozen Sun.

                If a person prepares for a session in a room with these tones, then the process is easier. Since yellowness indicates quick wit, resourcefulness and curiosity. There is also an opinion that foods belonging to this spectrum have a beneficial effect on the body. Apples, bananas and other fruits relieve depression, give a good mood.

                But there is also a negative side: in floristry, this palette is a symbol of separation. Often, such objects can activate the development of frustration, as well as provoke anger.
    	   </p>
            <p>
                The main thing with which the shade is associated even in the smallest children is the Sun. After all, this huge star from the plane of the Earth looks bright yellow. All this is explained from a scientific point of view: the atmosphere surrounding our planet absorbs a certain amount of light waves.<br> 
                But when thinking about a yellowish tone, images of all kinds of plants, fruits, and animals are also presented. After all, it is quite common in nature, so the list of representatives of flora and fauna will be too long. 
                But even if you ask the kids such a question, they will immediately say about chickens, lemons and bananas, about dandelions and sunflowers.
            </p>
    	    <p>
                The palette has both positive and negative symbolism. For example:

                <BR> <b>♡</b> humor;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> warm;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> joy;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> fun;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> sociability;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> summer season;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> cheerfulness;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> deception;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> avarice;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> betrayal;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> treason;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> envy;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> sarcasm;
                <BR> <b>♡</b> parting.
                <BR><br>
                It is worth paying attention to the fact that different shades have their own characteristics. For example, pale often indicates lies or greed.

            </h2>
            <p>  
                Color combination:<br>    
                💛❤️Yellow pairs with red to create a vibrant, festive, spontaneous palette that should be used with care. These two tones, as representatives of a pronouncedly warm range, excite the psyche, mobilizing everything, including reserve forces, to which the body does not always agree.
                The brighter the red, the more catchy the combination. More muted shades, such as dark, burgundy, cherry, can make the combination more noble, and a pronounced contrast of light-dark will give clarity to the border lines.
                <br>
                💛🧡The combination of yellow and orange colors is a warm, related range, which does not intentionally create a gradient, as the eye completes the intermediate shades. This allows you to deepen the main tone and give it a pure ardor, like the fire of a flame. The darker the orange, the more pronounced the light contrast, but the more complex tones will introduce a deterrent.
                The most successful expression of this composition is with a yellow-orange tint, since the unifying red will bring harmony closer to natural.
                Soft, pastel pairings with peach and pale orange give the palette a romantic twist.
                <br>
                💛💚The combination of yellow with warm green is one of the most pleasant, spring, sunny scales. The colors have a unifying factor in the form of a base color, but unlike the yellow-orange palette, the combination is more laid back. Yellow-green colors, although splashing with benevolence, promises are still in a colder spectrum than the described tone, thereby setting a slight warm-cold contrast.
                Light shades of green almost blend into the background like a looped scale, but we still see intermediate tones. Darker ones create a juicy, expressive contrast like the sun and dense forest greenery.
                <br>
                💛💙Yellow and blue or blue - a combination based on the maximum contrast of warm-cold. Everything in it screams about the difference in shades and this is what makes it so graceful, full. Each color blooms in this union with lush colors, demonstrating its merits. And this quality is appreciated by many artists and designers. A vivid drama, stormy feelings and an eternal craving for the opposite are hidden in the palette.
                Light, blue tones emphasize the tenderness, femininity of colors, while blue and dark blue are like a challenge - non-standard, idealism.
                <br>
                💛💜The combination of yellow with violet, lilac, purple belong to the category of the highest expressive pair, as they are based on the principle of additional contrast (the colors are on the same straight line in the Itten circle and when the color rays are mixed they give gray). This combination is an amazing tool in the hands of the creator, who can make you immerse yourself in complete harmony, only thanks to these two sensations of color. However, in some cases, the combination will seem too clumsy, intrusive, flat. Therefore, the more complex, cloudier the tone of both the first and second, the more pleasant the overall impression.
                <br>
                💛🤎Yellow color is combined with brown, creating life-affirming compositions based on family unity, natural beauty and deep light, brightness contrast.
                A calm, pacifying palette is usually created on the basis of complex yellow, pale, dusty ones. It is these that we most often see in nature, to which our consciousness, aesthetic feelings are drawn. But we can also assume the reverse side, where saturated browns set off bright yellows, enhancing the juiciness of the contrast.
                <br>
                💛🤍Yellow is combined with gray or silver as rich and neutral, but unlike the previous version, it has a thermal contrast that enhances expressiveness.
                The combination is distinguished by stylish rigor. In the case of light shades, the couple acquires lightness, sunny joy wins the battle with dullness. Gray and dark gray in combination activate light contrast, which is more catchy, strict, expressive. The darker the gray, the closer it is to the scandalous yellow-black duo.
