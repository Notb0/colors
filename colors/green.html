    	       Color psychology, details and associations
    	   </h2>
    	<p> 
    		A huge amount of this tone in nature is associated with the presence of chlorophyll. This is a special pigment found in the leaves and stems of many representatives of the flora. It allows plants to independently produce nutrients to sustain their life: this particle is an important link in such a process as photosynthesis. <br>

            Greenery is obtained by combining yellowness and blue, so it can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, it is recognized as the safest in the world. It is not for nothing that such a signal in a traffic light allows you to cross the roadway. On the other hand, it is a sign of life, harmony and tranquility. Everyone who looks at this tone will associate it with growth and development.
        </p>

            All cultures and nationalities have come to the common conclusion that this is a shade of prosperity. Such a meaning in our subconscious is associated with the awakening of nature in the spring, when the snowdrifts melt and young grass appears, the leaves of the trees bloom and everything around seems to come to life. Numerous religious festivals and traditions originate from this performance.<br><br>

            Some believe that this is the gamma of life force. It is able to compensate for the lack of energy at the psycho-emotional level. Varieties with a large drop of blue have a calming effect. This cold type is often used in the treatment of phobias, such as fear of closed spaces. Claustrophobic individuals suggest staying for a while in a room where the walls are painted a soft greenish. According to experiments, such an atmosphere makes it much easier to cope with the condition that occurs in a closed room.<br><br>
        </p>
        <p>
           It has long been considered a symbol of happiness and joy, harmony and peace, good luck and prosperity, as well as balance and wisdom. In past eras, the shade was associated with activities such as farming and gardening.<br><br>

            In the Orthodox religion, the palette is known as a sign of immortality, and in Islam it is the embodiment of paradise and life. Tone is very important in Ireland. Everyone knows that this is the main element of St. Patrick's Day. And the leprechaun is always depicted here in clothes made in greenery.

       Color combination
     </h2>
     <p>      
        Color combination: <br>
💚💗Green and pink are a soft, life-affirming couple, which in nature most often manifests itself in floral shades with greenery and thereby reinforces the feeling of youth, elegance. The palette is composed of pale pink, cloudy pink, sunset pink, Barbie, fuchsia.<br>


💚❤️The combination of green and red is based on the additional contrast of these shades, which leads to excessive sharpness, so red tones should be selected muted, for example, such as alizarin, red chicory, ruby, maroon, wine.<br><br>

💚🧡 The combination of green and orange is one of the most pleasant, rich, natural combinations. The harmony of this pair consists not only in the presence of the same color (yellow) in both, but in the presence of red in the latter (which is additional to the main one). Gamma consists of light peach, orange-coral, pumpkin, dark orange, red.<br>


💚💛The combination of green and yellow is harmonious, light, warm due to kinship: yellow is part of green. The bright unobtrusiveness of this combination is expressed in many variations. For example, couples with pale yellow, sunny, corn, amber, bright gold will attract.<br>

💚💙Combination of colors: green and blue - a related pair, where blue will be the unifying color. This is a moderate cold contrast, as well as light. Such a color scheme can become a background or be an independent element. It can be built using aquamarine, bright blue, turquoise, Prussian blue, thunderstorm.<br>


💚💜The combination of green and purple is rich, mysterious, also built on the relationship of shades. Purple, like green, has blue in its composition, as well as red, which is additional to the main one. Consider combinations with pale lilac, lavender, amethyst, purple, charoite.<br>

💚🤎The combination of green and brown is a natural, discreet, warm pair. Trees are one of the most peaceful sights, which is why the green-brown pair is one of the most pleasant and unobtrusive combinations. For example, take the colors oak, cocoa, tan, light chestnut, mahogany.<br>
