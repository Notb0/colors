    	Color psychology, details and associations
    	</h2>
    	<p> 
    		Red color is one of the most attractive and mysterious colors for a person from all existing ones. The duality of its meanings has been preserved from ancient times to the present day. Red was one of the main colors for primitive people, playing a significant role in their lives. For them, the red color, first of all, was the color of blood, and therefore could have both a positive meaning (blood at the birth of a new life) and a negative one (blood of murder, damage). In those days, red was used to scare away evil spirits, amulets, painting the faces of warriors, rites of purification, as well as for the treatment of wounds and diseases.
            <br>
            The psychology of red emphasizes its ambivalence in later beliefs: in ancient India it is the color of motherhood, in ancient Rome it is the color of the god of war.
            <br>
            In Goethe's work on the psychology of color perception, red belongs to the group of positive colors, that is, those that bring cheerfulness, activity, energy. Goethe and Kandinsky in their works on the psychology of color attributed strength, joy, maturity, energy to red.
            <br>

            According to modern research in the field of psychology of color perception, red is the favorite color of children, the most preferred color in childhood. Therefore, in color therapy for preschoolers, this color is necessarily used in working with children. Over time, color preferences change, this is due to the maturation of the central nervous system. Adults often prefer blue-green shades.
        </p>
        <p>
            Red in psychology means leadership, perseverance, perseverance, dynamism, but at the same time rigidity, intolerance, stubbornness, destruction. Red color is more often chosen by extroverts, leaders, powerful people, quick-tempered, active, energetic, passionate, gambling, self-confident, but not always ready to admit their mistakes and mistakes, sometimes not flexible enough and unwilling to give in.
