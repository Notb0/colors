    	Color psychology, details and associations
    	</h2>
    	<p> 
    		The symbolism of a multi-colored palette was developed in the ancient world, it was then that its first fans appeared. Many gods had cloaks or gems of this particular color. Sorcerers passed light through dark blue glass to cure the sick. Blueish veils were laid on sacred objects, such were the wigs of many rulers of the nobility even before our era.<br>

            Important ceremonies were performed with artificial hair dyed dark blue. In the Christian world, from ancient times they gave a designation to the blue color, as a symbol of mystery and sadness.<br>

            Many nations personify heaven, devotion, peace, tranquility and infinity with this tone. It is a symbol of stability and immutability, because the sky has not changed for millions of years. Eastern peoples believe that such a color scheme can protect against evil and otherworldly forces, protect from negative influences.<br>
        <p>
            From a psychological point of view, saturation and intensity also affect mood and general condition. Light influences neutrally or positively. If you look at such a palette for a long time, you can feel peace and tranquility, relax and relieve stress. But this applies only to heavenly and other pale tones.<br><br>

            If the color of the walls is intense and deep, it will cause negative emotions. Our subconscious is so arranged that for some people it can be associated with danger, cause anxiety. If you look at a thing of a saturated shade for a long time, discomfort appears.<br>

            If you choose the right colors and their saturation, you can improve the psychological state, direct yourself in the right direction and gather emotionally. For any girl, a certain palette necessarily correlates with memories and events from life.<br><br>

            If you follow psychology, the love of blue often reflects a woman of purpose. She has selflessness in her character, along with a desire to defend her opinion and position. If you choose clothes in a similar color scheme, then it will look strict and serious. This speaks of high spirituality and a thirst to achieve one's own. If you paint the working background in this way, then it will calm and normalize the nervous system, help to extinguish strong emotions, find inner peace.

     	</h2>
     	<p><img src="styles\image\blue_shadow.PNG" class="image"><br>
            The entire palette of blue can be divided into the following groups:<br>
            💙 medium blue are the fundamental tones: blue-blue, royal blue, dazzling blue<br>
            💙 with a touch of yellow: blue-green: sea wave, blue-green, Prussian blue<br>
            💙with a purple undertone (an admixture of red): cornflower blue, royal, blue-violet<br>
            💙bright blue: electric blue, bright blue, ultramarine<br>
              dark blue - they are divided into two subgroups:<br>
            💙medium-dark blue: indigo, sapphire, cobalt<br>
            💙dark blue with green undertones: dark blue-green, thunderstorm, black-blue<br>
            💙grey-blue: denim, gray-blue, midnight moon<br>

      <h2>
       Color combination
     </h2>
     <p> Color combination:<br>     
        💙💗Blue and pink - fresh, soft, contrasting. Pale pink shades give the pair freshness, and bright, based on fuchsia - boldness, and at the same time, femininity. The palette is made up of royal pink, carnation, white-lilac, Barbie, magenta.<br>


        💙❤️The combination of blue and red is rich, flashy, powerful. If we take medium red, then its lightness is the same as the main tone, therefore, for greater expressiveness, the shade of red should be lighter or darker than the partner color. Consider tandems with light red, garnet, dark red, ruby, burgundy.<br>


        💙🧡The combination of blue and orange is one of the most expressive, since orange is an additional color to the main paint. Pure mid-blues next to bright oranges give a lot of contrast, which can be provocative, so muted shades will be a better option. For an example of a combination with light peach, yellow peach, orange coral, sea buckthorn, fiery.<br>



        💙💛The combination of blue and yellow is expressive and positive. Warm, light yellow maximizes mid-blue, emphasizing its saturation. Such a contrast is very catchy, which dictates its use. The composition consists of apricot, corn, mustard, amber, tan.<br>


        💙💚Blue is combined with warm shades of green, forming a soft scale with a slight warm-cold resonance. Such pairs can become both a wealthy combination and a background for warmer shades. Combine medium blue with pistachio, light green, love toad, moss, dark green.<br>
        Blue is combined with cool shades of green, creating a marine palette. A cool gamma is more of a background than a main element, but its freshness and transparency will help the creator achieve the desired result. The composition includes the color of water, menthol, jade, patina, malachite.<br>


        💙🤎The combination of colors: blue and brown is expressive, but discreet. Since brown can be called a derivative of orange, which is a complementary color to the main tone, this combination is one of the most attractive. However, browns are in the same light range as mid-blues, which deprives the pair of the most effective light contrast that can always be brought in with additional paint. Pairs with camel, oak, tan, sepia, chocolate will be successful.<br>
