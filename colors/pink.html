    	<h2>
    	Color psychology, details and associations
    	</h2>
    	<p> 
    	Let's start with the fact that the tone is based on a mixture of red and white (with a possible admixture of lilac, orange, gray). The combination itself is unobtrusive, non-aggressive, with minimal emotionality. It can be warm and gentle or colder, richer, but in most cases it evokes positive emotions. I rank this color among the group of antidepressant colors that can evoke thoughts of cloudless happiness. 
        </p>
    	<p>
         This color scheme is considered feminine. Another stereotype connects her with childhood and associates with immaturity, youth. In fact, both pale pink and its brighter equivalents have a wide symbolism, therefore adults, serious people should not avoid these colors in their wardrobe or when decorating rooms.

         In ancient Rome, peach and cherry shades were associated with the goddess of love and beauty, Venus. Representatives of Eastern countries also appreciated them, using them in meditation to relax and improve concentration.

        Pink is firmly entrenched in our culture, accompanying various social experiences in different periods. From childhood, girls are surrounded by this color, presenting it as a kind of reflection of their gender. Therefore, many men hide their attachment to this tone so as not to cause public condemnation.
