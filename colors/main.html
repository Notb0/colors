    		Whether we realize it or not, colors have a certain impact on our entire lives. <br>Usually we intuitively look for the color we need. If we feel tired in the morning, we involuntarily choose clothes in warm and vibrant colors - orange, yellow or red. Subtly sensitive people choose colors most accurately. These are usually women, as men are more closely bound by social boundaries and often suppress the desire to wear clothes of the desired color.

           Methods for describing and evaluating color
            </h2>
    	<p>
    		The human eye is not capable of objectively assessing color, but there are devices that accurately measure color. Instrumental methods allow you to determine the color as a number based on a standard measurement system using colorimeters and spectrophotometers. The mathematical notation for color was developed by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) and corresponds to visual perception.

            Today, the color wheel of Johannes Itten, a Swiss artist, art theorist and teacher, is widely used in painting, design, architecture and applied arts. His 12-part color wheel shows the world's most common arrangement of colors, their interaction with each other. Itten distinguished primary colors, second-order colors (green, purple and orange), which are obtained by mixing a pair of primary colors, and third-order colors, which are obtained by mixing a primary color with a second-order color. For example, yellow mixed with green will be called light green by ordinary people, but in color science it is called yellow-green.

        Color can be described using three coordinates, such as hue, lightness, and saturation of the color being measured.Hue is a color property dependent on radiation of a certain wavelength, which is distinguished by receptors located in the eye. Then we see a certain color, such as green, red or blue. Colors that have shades are called chromatic.Lightness or, in other words, brightness is the sensitivity to the intensity of the radiation responsible for the appearance of color. A measure of the lightness of a color is brightness, which in daylight is characterized by the highest value for a yellow-green color with a wavelength of 555 nm, and at night at a wavelength of 510 nm, corresponding to blue-green color.Saturation is the mixing of a chromatic color with white, gray, or black. Pastel colors are called desaturated because they contain a lot of white.The presented color attributes are also standardized by the CIE system, thanks to which it is possible to fully describe the color by these three variables.
