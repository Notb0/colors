    	<h2>
    		Color psychology, details and associations
    	</h2>
    	<p>
    		Purple is the color of the unearthly, the unknown, the color of the cosmos, melancholy, moderation, isolation. He is detached from worldly reality, goes beyond the ordinary. This is due to its heavenly origin. What do you feel when you look at the starry sky?
    	</p>
    	<p>
    		In psychology, purple is primarily associated with sensuality and strong emotionality. Quite often, purple expresses psychological immaturity and instability of the nervous system. For this reason, people with an unstable psyche and teenagers love purple.


    	</p>
        <p> Since Violet is the color of the cosmos, in psychology it is most often associated with absolutely non-material spheres, or indeed with the cosmos, the Universe, something higher.
            Or with spiritual vision, imagination, other worlds. This is the color of imagination and inspiration, creative people.
            Following further associations, it is also the color of dreams, the flight of the subconscious, secrets within a person, the color of psychologists. This is the most introspective color.
            In addition, it is the color of magic and mysticism.
            As well as esoteric and spiritual practices.
            Due to its association with the intangible and being one of the darkest colors on the spectrum, purple is associated in many cultures with the afterlife.
            At the same time, purple is also the color of the upper crown chakra, which is responsible for spirituality, insight and unity with the Universe.
            The associations associated with purple also depend on the hue. The darker the color, the more mystical it is. Light lilac is close in association to blue and pink, its components. This is the color of dreamers, while it is perceived as more unpredictable than pink and blue. The color is closer to blue - indigo - the color of the night sky, mystery and knowledge. We talked about him as a shade of blue.<br>In some countries of Western Europe, purple is associated with crucifixion - a way of life and death, communion with the divine.
            In addition, purple used to be considered an attribute of wealth and luxury, since such a dye was very expensive. To this day, the collective memory of this lives on in how purple total looks seem frilly and extravagant.

      <h2>
       Color combination
     </h2>
    
     <p>
       Violet color, as a medium or dark tone, is most often involved in light contrast. There is also a thermal contrast, but color resonance will still occupy a special place, since juicy combinations are the hallmark of this shade. Each shade enhances adjacent colors in its own way. Medium moderate purple and eggplant succeeded best in this, while bright more overshadows the adjacent shades, pale looks better in a non-contrasting combination.
       <br><br>
       💜💗The combination of purple and pink is mysteriously shimmering, juicy, but not unobtrusive. Cold tones of pink are a continuation of even very dark purple tones, as they are built from purple. Such couples go beyond the ordinary and strive for the unknown sides of the universe. Warm tones enter into thermal contrast, thereby arranging an explosion of emotions. These dynamic tandems are always ready to please the eye. The lighter the shade of pink, the more clearly the contours of the contact of colors are outlined, the more the perception of the form is assimilated, the ornament is drawn. With dark tones - the main color deepens.
       <br>
       💜❤️Combination: purple and red - exciting, enveloping, sensual. It resembles a seething ocean, which consists of colors, sensations, images. And the brighter and lighter the red, the more powerful this impression. However, burgundy shades can no less effectively combine with our color: noble crimson, ruby, cherry wine tones delicately shade the background, while maintaining the dynamics of the emotional combination.
       <br>
       💜🧡Violet is combined with orange expressively, catchy. A deep warm-cold resonance fills the couple with exciting tension. Bright shades of orange will be a striking force in such a combination, when more complex, multifaceted ones will be able to reveal their inner beauty. For the main color, it doesn’t matter what subtone orange has: red or yellow, they will be equally harmonious in the composition, and even pale light tones will look juicy when paired with the main color.
       <br>
       💜💛The combination of purple and yellow contrasts to the highest degree, as it is based on an additional resonance. These two colors are considered absolutely opposite, because when such color rays are mixed, gray light can be seen. This pair is so spectacular that it may seem vulgar, so in order to achieve exquisite beauty, it is worth choosing complex, sometimes very muted shades of yellow, with orange, gold, beige undertones. Gold will look incomparable with any purple hue.
       <br>
       💜💚The combination of purple and warm green is softer than other warm contrasts. However, the yoke of shades is not violated here either. Any, even pale green next to the main tone looks saturated, lively, voluminous. This makes it possible to enhance the beauty of living greenery: bouquets, flowers in pots, etc. You can use bright flashes in the form of chartreuse to liven up the palette.
       <br>
       💜💙The combination of purple and blue relies mainly on light contrast. It is he who makes the pair a bright color, but thanks to the properties of the main tone, even the white-blue color will be able to retain its delicate appearance and not merge into a white spot on a dark background. Thus, blue shades, like flickering lights, glow in a purple-violet palette.
       <br>
       💜🤎The combination of purple and brown is juicy, balanced. Returning to the thermal contrast, we see a revival, but all the stormy compositions are left with pure warm shades. Brown is a complex tone, it is close to neutral, but unlike them, it has the ability to enhance the adjacent color. This makes the combination rich, even if gray-brown shades are used.
       <br>

       💜🤍The combination of gray and purple is stable, stylish. Perhaps only this shade brings restrained severity to the combination. Combinations with cold, steely grays will be more sonorous, when warm shades can give a feeling of softness. Silver sheen, although inferior in emotional richness to gold, still no less elegantly sets the main tone.
